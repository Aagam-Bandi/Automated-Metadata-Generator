    "Approach used in the Project:\n",
    "1. In the problem statement we are told that the files may be of the format txt, docx or pdf. For docx and txt files we can directly extract text without doing ocr as they contain text in digitally recognizable format.\n",
    "2. For pdf files, we might have to do ocr as they may be a scanned pdf and may not contain the text in digitally recognisable format. So we are using a ocr_fallback_threshold where if the text extracted from the page of pdf is less than a particular threshold (ocr_fallback_threshold) it would mean that the page is scanned and ocr is needed. Otherwise we would directly extract all the text. We are doing ocr for all the pages as it will slow down the process of metadata generation. If there is a little text present in the pdf in form of image elements we can skip them as it won't matter in our overall goal of semantically rich metadata generation.\n",
    "3. Now since most llms have input token limit, so we cannot give the whole pdf to the llm for metadata generation. So instead we'll be first chunking the pdf, and using the llm to summarize each chunk while preserving the metadata and then combine the summaries of all the chunks.\n",
    "4. We are also using RAG in our approach. Once the combined summary has been generated we will give the combined summary to the llm telling it to generate relevant questions that can be answered using the pdf and can be used in RAG to retrieve chunks which will be relevant for metadata generation.\n",
    "5. Now we are giving the chunks retrieved from RAG along with the combined_summary to the llm for metadata generation. And we are getting the metadata as the final output."

It begins by introducing amines as ammonia derivatives and discussing their classification, nomenclature, preparation, properties, and uses. The text then delves into aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, covering their nomenclature, structure, preparation, reactions, properties, and uses. Key topics include oxidation and reduction reactions, nucleophilic addition reactions, and electrophilic substitution reactions. The document highlights the importance of these compounds in various applications, including pharmaceuticals, dyes, solvents, and the chemical industry. It also contains in-text questions, example problems, and solutions to aid in understanding and application of the concepts. Aromatic and aliphatic amines are compared and contrasted. Additionally, topics such as the Gabriel phthalimide synthesis, Hoffmann bromamide degradation, Sandmeyer reaction, Gattermann reaction, Tollens’ test, Fehling's test, Aldol condensation, Cannizzaro reaction, and esterification are explained. The role of Grignard reagents and ozonolysis in preparing aldehydes and ketones are also discussed. The document also contains practice problems involving synthesis completion, explanation of chemical phenomena and identification of unknown organic compound based on its reactions and composition.\",\n",

      "And a more engineering-oriented one:\n",

      "(e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular (nonspam, also called “ham”) emails,\n",
      "can learn to flag spam. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the train‐\n",
      "ing set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample). In this case, the\n",
      "task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training data, and the\n",
      "performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of\n",
      "correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called accuracy,\n",
      "and it is often used in classification tasks.\n",
